All of the application questions are answered directly in my html doc, outside of the license plate program which you can view separately. You can also view my submission video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzfGzr4JRjk and my website live at www.gamese7enstudio.com/CodeFoo.
Note: Please take License_Plate_Foo as my programming submission. Thanks!
