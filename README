All of the Code Foo application questions are answered directly in my html doc. You can also view the license plate program and its code separately. My submission video is live at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzfGzr4JRjk and my website at www.gamese7enstudio.com/CodeFoo.

Note: My Java program labeled platesByCodeFoo runs in a applet, the other (licensePlates) directly in the Java console. Thanks!

Take it easy,
